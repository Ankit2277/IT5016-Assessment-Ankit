#Code Organization

This is in a simple text based structured adventure game code. Among them, there are several parts of the game corresponding to some part of the game with Changing the choice moment designation of the action taking place.

#Input/Output

This takes an instance of a use input and couple with the print function for displaying output to the user. This can be categorised as a type of input/output handling though it is the simplest kind.

#Conditional Statements

The solution is based on if-elif-else statements, which allow only the determined activity to be offered to the user when he/she enters the proper value. This is where there is a contingency of their pattern of flow whereby directions are based on inputs provided by the user.

#Decision Points

The script consists of several branches, where the user gets to make a choice (for instance, “left” or “right”, “swim” or “walk” and so on). This is considered as an instance of decision node, whereby the decision made by the user leads to the next activity in the game.

#Error Handling

Very simple error handling is included where an incorrect input results in a print message together with the end of the game. This is an instance of error detection and control, it tries to deal with any unexpected input that gets to it.

#Software Design Principles

Here are some software design principles that are relevant to this code:

Separation of Concerns: If followed in such a way, it narrows the program into different portions where each portion symbolizes a situation or an occurrence of a game. This to me makes code more maintainable because getting to review the code and get an idea of what the code does is easily done.
Single Responsibility Principle: Facets of the program, including the procedures dedicated to reading the user input, are concerned only with a single, clearly defined task.
Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY): There are scenarios in the code where instead of typing the same operations frequently are co-erced by functions or loops.
KISS (Keep it Simple, Stupid): The code has less process complexity, they are not heavily complex codes to understand.

Readme File Explanation

#Adventure Game

To those familiar with text based games this is a very basic adventure game. The game offers a sequence of choices and what one is likely to select determines what the result will be. 

#How to Play

Play the game through running the code of the game.
Type your name when prompted.
Go through the a series of decision making by typing left or right, swim or walk and so on.
The result of various choices you make will be reflected through the responses of the game.
Game Logic

To make it easier, the game’s logic is divided into sections to cover a particular situation or an option. A lot of conditional statements are used in the code which determine further execution of the game based on the user’s command.

#Error Handling

The program has some error control or a rudimentary kind, where any wrong input leads to an error message, then game termination.

#Design Principles

Most of the code follows certain principles for software design to include; separation of concerns; single responsibility principle; Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY); Keep It Stupid Simple (KISS).
